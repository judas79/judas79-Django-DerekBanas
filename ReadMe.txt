These are my notes and files from DerekBanas Django tutorial by Derek Banas.  There are also some tips added by me,
for example, a quick way to runserver in the Tutorial 1 folder.  Some lessons take place in sub folders and they will
be like that in this repo., as well.

On all the files, in the lessons.  I will be using the letter 'L' for lesson and the number after it will be the lesson
number that the portion of code was derived from.  L5 for example would be from Lesson 5.

When the code is using django and or bootstrap, it will be noted, in the code comments on lesson 1 till the end of the
lessons.

Be aware, that some of the files will be renamed, with the pre-name containing the lesson number it was used in.  This is
because, as the lessons progress, some of the code will be depreciated, or changed completely, to make the topic lesson
function correctly.  Example views.py may be changed in lesson 5 so drastically has to have to be replaced, but lets say
remained structurally the same up until then; we would rename it L1_to_L4_views.py.

Share these files freely, for this is just all meant to be an exercise in using: Django, PyCharm, and git within PyCharm
pro, to access and organise my learning on git-hub.

In some of the lessons text files, there will be references to Dereks' skeletal structure, (Code Layout), with a number
in it (12 Code Layout).  This is from when Derek, was first organizing his code layout plan, as far as what was needed
to achieve how the site would be organised.
