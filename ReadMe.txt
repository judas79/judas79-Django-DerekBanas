These are my notes and files from DerekBanas Django tutorial by Derek Banas.  There are also some tips added by me,
for example, a quick way to runserver in the Tutorial 1 folder.  Some lessons take place in sub folders and they will
be like that in this repo., as well.

On all the files, in the lessons.  I will be using the letter 'L' for lesson and the number after it will be the lesson
number that the portion of code was derived from.  L5 for example would be from Lesson 5.

When the code is using django and or bootstrap, it will be noted, in the code comments on lesson 1 till the end of the
lessons.

Share these files freely, for this is just all meant to be an exercise in using: Django, PyCharm, and git within PyCharm
pro, to access and organise my learning on git-hub.
