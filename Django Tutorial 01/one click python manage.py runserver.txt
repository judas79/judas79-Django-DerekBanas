THIS WAS TAKEN FROM ANOTHER TUTORIAL I WAS LEARNING.  YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE LOCATION OF THE FILES, TO THE LOCATION
YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING:

This is how to make a one click answer, for lazy people like me, that do not want to type commands to run the server,
every time the server needs to be run, to see if your project will run.  I put the knowledge gathered, from two links,
together, to come up with the following answer.

https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/97162-powershell-scripting-run-script-shortcut.html

The examples in this git-hub repo will have to be modified, with the paths, of the computer, on which the scripts will
be run.  I made this as simple as I could illustrate, but look at the links above, for further assistance, if this how to,
fails to work properly.

At the end of this small 'how to' you will have two scripts; one for PowerShell that runs the server, and a shortcut,
for your desktop or task-bar, to launch PowerShell.

1. Open Notepad and paste the following script into the new document. Change your path, to your corresponding path,
where bucky (theNewBoston), got you to set up the django lesson folder, in which the manage.py resides.

invoke-expression 'cmd /c start powershell -Command { cd CHANGE PATH HERE; python .\manage.py runserver }'

[EXAMPLE]
invoke-expression 'cmd /c start powershell -Command { cd C:\Users\Roddy\PycharmProjects\djangotheNewBoston; python .\manage.py runserver }'

2.  On the bottom of notepad click 'all files' and save your file as 'whateverYouWantName'.ps1

The instructions in this tutorial as image examples and is a lot easier to follow than if I typed out instruction in a
text.  So, head here and continue where I left off, by creating a shortcut, from 'whateverYouWantName'.ps1

https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/97162-powershell-scripting-run-script-shortcut.html

return here after creating the shortcut, from the website above's tutorial:

Leave both the *.ps2 and the *.lnk (shortcut), in the folder that contains the manage.py script, and right click on the
*.ps1 and click "pin to task-bar'.

This same tutorial can most like be applied to running other scripts and apps using PowerShell.

Look at my django Derek Banas tutorials, on how to create a similar sequence, using the command prompt to activate a
virtual env and then go to the working folder 'sampserver, in that tutorial... with one click!
